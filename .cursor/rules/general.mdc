# GENERAL PROJECT CONVENTIONS

## Language & Frameworks
- All frontend code must be in **TypeScript** using **Next.js 15 App Router**.
- All backend logic should use **Server Actions**, **background functions** via Inngest, or Python microservices.
- Long-running or async workflows must use **Inngest**, triggered by events or actions.
- AI workflows must use **AgentKit via Inngest agents** and follow composable, tool-based agent patterns.

## Folder & File Structure
- Store backend logic in `/actions/`, `inngest/functions/`, or `/python/` as appropriate.
- Store React components in `@/components/ui/` and keep them reusable and decoupled.
- Use PascalCase for component and file names (`AgentOrchestrator.tsx`), camelCase for functions/variables (`handleSubmit`).
- Separate reusable logic into `/lib/` or `/utils/`.

## Imports
- Prefer absolute imports (e.g., `@/lib/utils`) over relative paths.
- Group imports: external libs, internal modules, then styles.
